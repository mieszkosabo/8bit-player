## 8bit-player ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ§

A simple project to check out some basic usage of Spotify's API. I also did some baby steps with HTML Canvas element, so I ended up with this simple 8bit/minecraft-ish player that (for now) is actually not a player, but rather displays what you listen to on spotify at the moment in a cool way.

### how to run?
Actually you can check it out instantly by visiting https://8bit-player.hostman.site/.
If you want to play with code, clone master branch, get your API key from Spotify and change it in api_config.js
I guess you could run it using my key, but I don't know how Spotify would feel about it.
But you can get your own key in less than a minute and learn more about api here: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login

Then inside project folder type `npm install && npm start`.

### some libraries I used
- react, redux, reselect, redux-observable, rambda
- react-spotify-auth, js-cookie
- styled-components, styled-tools, react-bootstrap, react-loader-spinner
